Title: Smart Spender

Description: A lot of people use their credit/debit cards, but they don’t actually review their statements consistently. This leads to people spending money on things they don’t need before realizing that they’ve spent too much to afford the things they still do need. This app solves this by allowing users to see an overview of their spending habits over a certain period of time. Users will be able to check and see what categories they are spending their money in (groceries, eating out, gas, rent, etc.). It will allow users to better gauge how much money they should budget for each category in the future.
